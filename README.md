# Digital-Clock-2

The program initializes the LCD pins and defines some strings to hold the time and date information. The time and date are kept track of using integer variables for hours, minutes, seconds, day, month, and year. There are functions to update the time and date strings based on the integer variables, as well as functions to adjust the time and date based on user input from buttons. The program also sets up a timer using Timer0 to keep track of the seconds, and uses interrupts to update the time on the display.
